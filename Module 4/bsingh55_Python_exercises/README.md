# Module 4 - Python Exercises

This module consists of three Python programming exercises focused on string manipulation, sorting, and file handling. These exercises help reinforce basic Python concepts like list processing, string operations, conditional logic, and file I/O.

## 📁 Files Included

### Source Code
- `exercise1.py` – Replaces every vowel in a string with a hyphen (`-`).
- `exercise2.py` – Reads a list of strings from a file, sorts them alphabetically, and writes the sorted result to a new file.
- `exercise3.py` – Prompts the user to enter names until they type `done`, then displays the longest name entered.

### Supporting Files
- `strings.txt` – Input file containing a list of strings for `exercise2.py`.
- `sorted_strings.txt` – Output file generated by `exercise2.py`.

### Screenshots
- `exercise2_terminal_screenshot.png` – Screenshot showing execution of Exercise 2.
- `exercise3_terimal_screenshot.png` – Screenshot showing execution of Exercise 3.

## 📝 Assignment Document
- `Python Exercises 1.pdf` – Original assignment instructions.

## 💡 How to Run

Each script is self-contained and can be run using any Python 3 interpreter.

```bash
python3 exercise1.py
python3 exercise2.py
python3 exercise3.py
